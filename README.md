Summary
- This repository contains an Excel workbook which has been designed to help users track personal finances and investments. The workbook contains regions for input (such as transactions) and regions with automatic calculations to help summarize and visualize trends in your finances.

This spreadsheet is for personal use and to achieve my financial goals. 

Disclaimer
- This spreadsheet is simply a tool to aid you in tracking your finances; it should not be construed as legal, financial, or tax advice.
The formulas in the spreadsheet may contain errors, and I am not liable for any issues that arise from incorrect calculations.
The formulas in this spreadsheet have been extended to 10 years. If you record more than 10 years of data, you will need to manually extend some formulas.

I find it easiest to set aside time and input my transactions once at the end of the month, which takes roughly 10-20 minutes/month.
